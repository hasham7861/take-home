# Unsplash Gallery

This project demo: [Link to Demo](./demo/video-demo.mp4)

## packages used

- react-infinite-scroll-component for infinite scroll
- react-lazy-load-image-component for lazy load images
- yet-another-react-lightbox for light box
- didn't use any library for fetching images from unsplash as I thought it was overkill

## For the app to work

- You need to have .env file in your root directory, I will supply it privately, or you can copy the .env.sample to .env and put in your own REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID property

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`
